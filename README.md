# Tangram_Solver
Pentagons Formation using Tangram Pieces

# Question description

Tangram is one of the most popular games to play with. You put figures of 7 pieces together (five triangles, one square and one parallelogram). You must use all pieces. They must touch but not overlap.

All seven tangram pieces consist of many half squares(triangles), each with this shape:

There are 32 half squares or 16 squares altogether.

We could take the half-squared triangle as the basic form, because each square built for all seven tangram pieces has the simple length (perimeter) of 4 units.

There are many convex and non-convex figures/shapes of pentagons that you can build from all the 7 tangram pieces. Some of them are given below.

In this project, you are required to use AI search methods (uninformed search methods such as Breadth First search, Depth First search, Iterative Deepening and Uniform Cost search) and (Informed or heuristic search methods such as Greedy search, A* algorithm and Iterative Deepening version of A* : IDA*) to perform pattern matching, recognition and pentagons formation.
